# Humzah Malik 9fin Task Solution

Before running the solution within main.ipynb, please follow the instructions within installation_instructions.md. This will instruct you on how to:

1. Download Conda (if not already installed).
2. Create a Conda environment.
3. Run requirements.txt to install the required Python packages.
4. Run main.ipynb without any dependency problems.

Thank you for taking the time to read over my solution!
